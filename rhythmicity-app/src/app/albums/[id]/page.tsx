I bet you're prolly sick of me now\nAin't you, Mama? I'ma make you look so ridiculous now!\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)\nI said I'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Ha!)\n\n[Verse 2]\nI got some skeletons in my closet and I don't know if no one knows it\nSo before they throw me inside my coffin and close it\nI'ma expose it; I'll take you back to '73\nBefore I ever had a multi-platinum-selling CD\nI was a baby, maybe I was just a couple of months\nMy faggot father must've had his panties up in a bunch\nâ€˜Cause he split, I wonder if he even kissed me goodbye\nNo, I don't, on second thought, I just fuckin' wished he would die\nI look at Hailie, and I couldn't picture leavin' her side\nEven if I hated Kim, I'd grit my teeth and I'd try\nTo make it work with her at least for Hailie's sake, I maybe made some mistakes\nBut I'm only human, but I'm man enough to face 'em today\nWhat I did was stupid, no doubt it was dumb\nBut the smartest shit I did was take the bullets out of that gun\nâ€˜Cause I'da killed 'em, shit, I woulda shot Kim and him both\nIt's my life, I'd like to welcome y'all to The Eminem Show\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)\nI said I'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (Uh)\n\n[Verse 3]\nNow, I would never diss my own mama just to get recognition\nTake a second to listen 'fore you think this record is dissin'\nBut put yourself in my position, just try to envision\nWitnessin' your mama poppin' prescription pills in the kitchen\nBitchin' that someone's always goin' through her purse and shit's missin'\nGoin' through public housing systems, victim of MÃ¼nchausen's Syndrome\nMy whole life I was made to believe I was sick when I wasn't\n'Til I grew up, now I blew up, it makes you sick to your stomach, doesn't it?\nWasn't it the reason you made that CD for me, Ma?\nSo you could try to justify the way you treated me, Ma?\nBut guess what, you're gettin' older now, and it's cold when you're lonely\nAnd Nathan's growin' up so quick, he's gonna know that you're phony\nAnd Hailie's gettin' so big now, you should see her, she's beautiful\nBut you'll never see her, she won't even be at your funeral (Ha-ha!)\nSee, what hurts me the most is you won't admit you was wrong\nBitch, do your song, keep tellin' yourself that you was a mom!\nBut how dare you try to take what you didn't help me to get?!\nYou selfish bitch, I hope you fuckin' burn in hell for this shit!\nRemember when Ronnie died and you said you wished it was me? (Hehe)\nWell, guess what? I am deadâ€”dead to you as can be!\n\n[Chorus]\nI'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet (One more time!)\nI said I'm sorry, Mama\nI never meant to hurt you\nI never meant to make you cry\nBut tonight I'm cleanin' out my closet",

I don't know, go figure\nMeanwhile back in Queens the realness and foundation\nIf I die, I couldn't choose a better location\nWhen the slugs penetrate, you feel a burnin' sensation\nGettin' closer to God in a tight situation now\nTake these words home and think it through\nOr the next rhyme I write might be about you\n\n[Chorus]\nSon, they shook\n'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks\nScared to death, scared to look, they shook\n'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks\nScared to death, scared to look\nLivin' the life that of diamonds and guns\nThere's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds\nSo some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns\nCowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones\nHe ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one\n\n[Verse 2: Havoc]\nFor every rhyme I write it's twenty-five to life\nYo, it's a must, in gats we trust, safeguardin' my life\nAin't no time for hesitation, that only leads to incarceration\nYou don't know me, there's no relation\nQueensbridge and we don't play\nI don't got time for your petty-thinkin' mind\nSon, I'm bigger than those\nClaimin' that you pack heat, but you're scared to hold\nAnd once the smoke clears, you'll be left with one in your dome\nThirteen years in the projectsâ€”my mentality is what, kid?\nYou talk a good one, but you don't want it\nSometimes I wonder, do I deserve to live?\nOr am I gonna burn in Hell for all the things I did?\nNo time to dwell on that, 'cause my brain reacts\nFront if you want, kid, lay on your back\nI don't fake jax, kid, you know I bring it to you live\nStay in a child's place, kid, you out of line\nCriminal minds thirsty for recognition\nI'm sippin', E&J got my mind flippin'\nI'm buggin', diggin' my ways out of holes by hustlin'\nGet that loot, kid, you know my function\n'Cause long as I'm alive, I'ma live illegal\nAnd once I get on, I'ma put on all my peoples\nReact quick, spit lyrics like MACs, I hit your dome up\nWhen I roll up, don't be caught sleepin', 'cause I'm creepin'\n\n[Chorus]\nSon, they shook\n'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks\nScared to death, scared to look, they shook\n'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks\nScared to death, scared to look, they shook\n(We live the life that of diamonds)\n'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks\nScared to death, scared to look, they shook\n'Cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks\nLivin' the life that of diamonds and guns\nThere's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds\nSo some get shot, locked down, and turn nuns\nCowardly hearts and straight up shook ones, shook ones\nHe ain't a crook, son, he's just a shook one\n\n[Outro]\nTo all the villains and a hundred dollar billers\nTo real brothers who ain't got no feelings\nG-yeah, the whole Bridge\nQueens get the money\n41st side, keepin' it real, you know\nQueens get the money\n\n[Produced by Havoc]",
